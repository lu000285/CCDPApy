Measurements differences compared to CL1
1.  No feed concentration, but have measurements after feeding.
2.  Sparse measurements in AA, except glutamine and glutamate.
3.  Supplements are different, including meadia feed, glucose feed, and base feed.

Ways to calculate cumulative comsuption of metabolites:
1.  Add a new column to calculate volume after feeding at time t. (Also append this column in other CLs)
    Formula: Volume After Sampling + Feed Media added + Glucose Added + Base Added
2.  Formula for cumulative consumption (S) of metabolites i at time t:
    S(i,t) = S(i,t-1) + [volume after feeding(t-1)*Conc(i,t-1) 
            - volume after feeding(t)**Conc(i,t)]/1000
    Notes: 
    a.  1000 is for unit conversion
    b.  When it is a sparse measurement, t-1 should be the previous time point that have the measurement.
