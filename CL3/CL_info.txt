Measurements differences compared to CL1
1.  No feed concentration and no concentration measurements after feeding
2.  Have calculated cumulative consumption of glucose and production of lactate


Ways to calculate cumulative comsuption of metabolites:
1.  Direct use the reported cumulative cons.of glucose. 
    Notes:
    a.	Beaware of the unit. It is [mM], so the caculation of specific rate is different.
    b.  Fommula = "time derivative of cumulative cons."/"viable cell concentraion (Xv) at time t"
2.  Calculate cumulative cons. of lactate (prod.), glutamine, asparagine, aspartate
    Formula for cumulative consumption (S) of i at time t:
    S(i,t) = S(i,t-1) + [volume after feeding(t-1)*Conc(i,t-1) 
            - volume after feeding(t)**Conc(i,t)]/1000
    Notes: 
    a.  1000 is for unit conversion
